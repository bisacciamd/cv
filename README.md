# My CV
- This bilingual CV is powered by R and Quarto and rendered on my portfolio website.
- At present, it is pre-rendered locally, although Github Actions integration is [planned](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv/issues/3)
- [Publications](https://cv.bisacciamd.com/publications) are currently manually added, but auto-update is [planned](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv/issues/7)
- To render in PDF, it uses a Quarto extension called [quarto-cv](https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-cv).
- The bilingual component is rendered with [Quarto profiles](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/profiles.html) under a custom [rendering routine](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv/blob/main/render_cv.sh).
