# My CV
- This CV is powered by R and Quarto and rendered on my portfolio website.
- At present, it is pre-rendered locally, although Github Actions integration is [planned](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv/issues/3)
- To render in PDF, it uses a Quarto extension called [quarto-cv](https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-cv).
